// The purpose of this file is to provide a utility function for combining class names conditionally.
// This is useful when you want to apply different classes based on certain conditions.
// The cn function takes an array of class names and merges them into a single string.
// It uses the clsx utility to handle the merging of class names and the tailwind-merge utility to handle the merging of tailwind classes.
// This allows you to easily construct class names based on different conditions in your components.
// For example, you could use cn to conditionally apply different styles to a component based on its state or props.
// This can help keep your code clean and maintainable by reducing the amount of conditional logic needed in your components.
